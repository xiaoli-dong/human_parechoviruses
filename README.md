Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are small, nonenveloped RNA viruses with icosahedral capsids, classified under the Picornaviridae family and Parechovirus genus. Their genomes consist of positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) approximately 7,300 nucleotides in length, divided into three regions: the 5′ untranslated region (UTR), the polyprotein coding region (P), which includes P1, P2, and P3, and the 3′ UTR. The genome is translated into a single polyprotein, which is cleaved by host proteases into three structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1) and seven non-structural proteins (2A-C, 3A-D). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), encoded by the 3D gene, is responsible for viral genome replication. The lack of proofreading by RdRp, along with recombination events within and between genotypes, contributes to the high genetic diversity of HPeV strains (Chieochansin et al., 2021).
