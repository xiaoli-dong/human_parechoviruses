Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are small, nonenveloped RNA viruses with icosahedral capsids. They belong to Picornaviridea family, Parechovirus genus. The human parechovirus genomes are positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which are approximately 7,300 nucleotides in length. The genome is divided into three parts, including 5′ untranslated region (UTR); polyproteins (P), which consist of P1, P2, and P3; and, 3′UTR. The viral genome translates into a single polyprotein. This translated protein is subsequently cleaved by host protease into three structural proteins, including VP0, VP3, and VP1; and, into seven non-structural proteins, including 2A-C and 3A-D. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is encoded from the 3D gene, is responsive for viral genome replication21,22. The lack of proofreading property of viral RdRp together with the recombination among intra- and inter-genotypes of the virus leads to high viral genome diversity (Chieochansin et al., 2021)
